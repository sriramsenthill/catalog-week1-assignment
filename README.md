# Catalog Week 1 Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a web application developed as part of the Catalog Week 1 Assignment, showcasing a responsive and modern user interface inspired by a Figma design. The application is built using HTML, Sass (SCSS), and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience.

## Design Inspiration

The user interface has been meticulously recreated based on a Figma design, ensuring pixel-perfect representation and adherence to the original design language. Key design elements include:
- Responsive layout
- Consistent color palette
- Intuitive user interactions
- Modern typography
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structured content
- **Sass (SCSS)**: Advanced CSS preprocessor for more maintainable stylesheets
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactions and functionality
- **NPM**: Package management and build tools
